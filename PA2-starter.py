'''
Make a flashcard review game that reads through a file
where each line consists of a term and its definition.

An example text file and an example CSV file have been provided to you.

A masterful program includes the ability to create a new file
and load your own terms/definitions into it, before running the quiz on that file.

Save game records to a different file. Log username and high score.
Allow the user the option to view this file by printing it to the console.

You should at minimum edit the helper functions.
You may not necessarily have to edit the main function.
